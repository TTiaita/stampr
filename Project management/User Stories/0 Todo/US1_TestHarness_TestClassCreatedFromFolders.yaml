    Description: >
        Given I have test folders in the /Testing folder
        When I run the test harness
        Then it should generate a test-unit class for each subfolder with the required subfolders
    Acceptance Criteria:
        - When the TestHarness is called, a test-unit Class is dynamically generated for each subfolder within the {Root}/Testing folder.
        - Generated test cases should have the same name as the original folder.
        - If a test folder does not contain a /Source and /Expected folder, do not create a test and display a command line warning.
