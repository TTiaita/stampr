    Description: >
        Given I have Stampr installed
        When I pass the 'run' command to the executable with an input path and an output path
        And the input path contains all required files
        Then Stampr should run against the input folder
        Amd Stampr should save the result to the output path
    Acceptance Criteria:
        - If the executable's run command is called without either an input and output parameter, throw error [#, CommandLine, 'InputPath and OutputPath are both required']
        - If the executable's run command is called without an output parameter, throw error [#, CommandLine, 'OutputPath is required']
        - If the executable's run command is called with more than two parameters, throw error [#, CommandLine, 'Too many arguments provided']
        - If the input path is not a folder, throw error [#, CommandLine, '{InputPath} is not a folder']
        - If the input path does not exist, throw error [#, CommandLine, '{InputPath} does not exist']
        - If the input path does not contain a folder named 'stampr', throw error [#, CommandLine, '{InputPath} does not contain the stampr folder']
        - If none of the errors above are thrown, trigger the 'run' function with OutputPath and InputPath as its parameters
        - If the output path/folder does not exist, Stampr should create it
        - Stampr should output its result to the specified output path.
