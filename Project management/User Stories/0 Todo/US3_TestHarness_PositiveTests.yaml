    Description: >
        Given I have a test folder that does not contain a negative.yaml file
        When I run the test harness
        Then the generated test case should be a positive test
        And the test should pass if and only if the /Output folder exactly matches the /Expected folder
    Acceptance Criteria:
        - A test folder which does not contain a negative.yaml file should generate a positive test case
        - Positive test cases should pass if and only if no errors occur and the generated output exactly matches (character for character) the files in the /Expected folder.
        - Otherwise the test case should fail.
