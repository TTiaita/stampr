    Description: >
        Given I have test folders in the /Testing folders
        When I run the test harness
        Then the generated test cases should have a setup function clearing previous runs
    Acceptance Criteria:
        - When the test harness generates test-unit classes, they contain a setup function which deletes all files in the /Output subfolder if it exists
