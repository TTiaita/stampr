    Description: >
        Given I have a folder that contains a negative.yaml file
        When I run the test TestHarness
        Then the generated test case should be a negative test
        And the test should pass if and only if an error matching the details of the negative.yaml file occurs
    Acceptance Criteria:
        - A test folder which does not contain a negative.yaml file should generate a positive test case
        - Negative test cases should pass if and only if an error occurs and it matches both the error code and error message defined in the negative.yaml file.
        - Otherwise the test case should fail.
